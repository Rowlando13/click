Contributing
======================

We are happy that you are thinking about contributing. 

For general information about contributing checkout Beeware_. Their materials are very good and align with our principles. The next sections contains technical details on how to contribute to Click, such as how to build the docs locally.

Documentation Guidelines
============================
We are slowly rewriting our documentation to fall into four categories, tutorials, how-to guides, reference information, topics. If you are considering helping rewrite a section, please take a look at Diataxis_.
